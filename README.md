# polyglot-programmer-java
Java repo for my polyglot programming projects. The goal is to get a taste of different programming languages by building three projects in each language:

- FizzBuzz - The classic mini-project, just to figure out the basics (DONE)
- Gallery - An image organizer app, to dig deeper (TODO)
- Specialty App - Some application that utilizes the best features of the language (TODO)
